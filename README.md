# <a name="inicio"></a>A Toolkit for Fortran90

This Fortran code provides a list of functions and subroutines that I typically use in my research. The toolkit assumes double precision for real variables. It contains functions of subroutines that can be classified in four categories:
- General propuse
- Statistics
- Linear algebra
- Optimization

Efficiency of the algorithms is not guaranteed, and the code is distributed under the MIT license.

For a complete list of functions and subroutines, please check [documentation](dasdas)
